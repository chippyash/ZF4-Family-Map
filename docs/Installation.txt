Family Map - Community Edition - Installation Instructions

Pre-requisites
--------------
LAMP stack web server (Linux, Apache, MySql, PHP) PHP at >= V5.3

Installation
------------
1/ Unarchive the distribution pack to a convenient location on your web server

2/ Create a database and database owner user with all access rights to the
   database in MySql

3/ Using your MySql admin account that has ALL rights, change to your new
   database and run the docs/database.sql file to create the tables,
   stored procedures  and base data

4/ Create a random crypto seed string of your choice.  uuidgen is a program that
   can be found for most platforms and easily creates a unique string. In a
   linux terminal for instance type
   uuidgen
   and use the resulting hash string.  Record the string and don't lose it.  All
   system passwords are hashed with this string, so once set and used it cannot 
   be changed.

5/ As database admin, change to your family map database and run the following
   sql command:

INSERT INTO `systUser` (`id`, `orgId`, `uName`, `uEmail`, `payrollId`, `uPwd`, `rowSts`, `lastLogon`, `lastIP`, `addDt`, `prsnId`) VALUES
(1, 1, '<your admin username>', '<your email address>', '0000', md5(concat("<your crypto seed>","<your password>")), 'active', '2012-01-01 00:00:00', '', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', NULL);

   replacing <your admin username>, <your email address>, <your crypto seed> 
   and <your password> with the appropriate values.

6/ Copy or soft link the application/config/fmlymap.apache.conf to your Apache
   vhost configuration.  Edit the vhost file to reflect the location of your
   installed copy of Family Map.  Please note that web root is the httpdocs
   subdirectory.  This ensures that your software is safe.  If you know how,
   you can also add additional security by creating appropriate open_basedir
   directives.

7/ Copy application/config/application.sample.ini to 
   application/config/application.ini

8/ Edit application/config/application.ini and search and replace following 
   tags:

 - %dbName%  -> name of your database
 - %dbHost%  -> host name for database server (usually localhost)
 - %dbUid$   -> user name for database access
 - %dbPwd%   -> password for database access user
 - %logNameTo% -> Email address for emailing error messages to
 - %logNameFrom% -> Email address that system will send log messages from
 - %cryptSeed% -> Crypto seed string that you created at step 4

9/ Copy application/config/mail.sample.xml to application/config/mail.xml

10/ Edit application/config/mail.xml and enter mail details as for application.ini
   The sample mail config is for an authenticated smtp server.  Please see the
   Zend_Mail documentation at http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.mail.html
   for details of how to set up for different scenarios

11/ Copy the application/configs/googlemapkey.sample.php file to
   application/configs/googlemapkey.php

12/ If you haven't already got one, go to http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html
   and signup for Google Maps API and generate a key for your site.
   Edit application/configs/googlemapkey.php and put your key in the relevant
   section of the configuration - usually ZF4_Defines::STAGE_PROD:

13/ Restart apache

14/ Browse to your installed url and sign on  with the uid and pwd that you set
    at step 5.

15/ Create a new organisation and user for that organisation. Enter the following
    details:

 - Tag - enter a three letter acronym for your organisation
 - Name, Address, Contact, Tel, Email - enter the details for your organisation
 - Map CLat, Map CLong - enter the latitude and longitude of your organisation
   as displayed on Google Maps.
 - License - enter None - this is not currently used
 - Admin Name - Enter the user name that will be the administrator for the 
   organisation
 - Admin Email - Enter the email address of the administrator.  The user will
   recieve an email with their account details
 - Admin Payroll No. - Enter your administrators organisational payroll number.

   This will set up your organisation and create an administrator account for
   it.  From now on you should logon to the system using that account.  So logoff
   now.

16/ Copy the the httpdocs/images/brand/WLC directory to a directory named after
   the tag you created for your organisation, e.g. if your tag is 'TST', then
   copy the httpdocs/images/brand/WLC to httpdocs/images/brand/TST.  Now replace
   the logo.jpg and word_logo.jpg files with images that reflect your organisation
   and that are the same size as the originals.  This will 'brand' the site
   with your logo when you log on.

17/ Log on again using your new organisation's admin uid and password.

18/ Read the online documentation to find out how you set up and maintain your
   organisation's data.
