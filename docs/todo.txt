Any software is in a state of constant amendment, whether due to bug fixing
of the implementation of new or enhanced features.  Family Map is no different.

The author of this software are particularly interested in seeking help with
the following tasks:

- Creation of a system installer to run once when application is first accessed.
  The installer will carry out the installation steps required in the 
  installation.txt file

- Creation and maintenance of distribution packages for Debian and Fedora/Red Hat
  based systems, i.e. .deb and .rpm packages that will locate the software in a
  sane location and configure the vhost file and restart Apache.  The distribution
  packages will also enforce necessary pre-requisite software dependencies.

- Refactoring to make the software less specific to schools

If you can help with these tasks, please do contact the author at GitHub where
you got this software from or via ashley [at] zf4 [dot] biz
