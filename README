ZF4 Family Map - Introduction
=============================

Family Map represents a breakthrough for schools and colleges managing their services to end users, whether they be 
students or others.

Family Map allows you map your service users against geographic areas to determine whether you are complying with 
your funding requirements to provide services. The system comes with an easy to use click and go query dialog 
allowing you to select just the data you need.

You maintain your own data securely and simply. Each authorised user has full access to only your data. The system 
logs all edit actions and logon attempts allowing you to track system usage.

The Reporting faclities are easy to use and let you get the information you want out of the system. You create 
reports in the same way that you use the mapping system and you can save your own report profiles for quick retrieval 
at a later time. Our smart software allows you to report on people that are within the geographic areas that you 
have defined for the map, giving you the ammunition you need to face the inspectors or better plan your services 
going forward.

Use the latest technology to gain a better understanding of the relationships between your members, pupils, staff, 
ancillaries and care workers. The fully interactive relationship map allows you to explore the links between people 
in the system in an intuitive fashion. The system allows you to define your own types of relationships and apply them 
only to the types of people that you specify.

To ease system usage, you can import your data into the system from spreadsheet files using the flexible import 
facilities
